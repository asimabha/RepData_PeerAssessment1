```

```r
### Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
###We will use the mean for the 5-minute interval to populate NA values for a given interval.
### Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
### merge original activity data frame with interval data frame
newactivity <- merge(activity, interval, by = 'interval', all.y = F)

### merge NA values with averages rounding up for integers
newactivity$steps[is.na(newactivity$steps)] <- as.integer(
    round(newactivity$mean_steps[is.na(newactivity$steps)]))

### drop and reorder columns to match original activity data frame

keeps <- names(activity)
newactivity <- newactivity[keeps]
### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
### (total number of (steps taken per day))
newtotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, newactivity, sum)

### add descriptive variable names
names(newtotal)[2] <- "sum_steps"

### check out new data frame
head(newtotal, 5)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


```r
###They do differ, but ever so slightly.
###mean(total) = 10766.19, while mean(newtotal) = 10765.64. Rounding produces the same value.
###median(total) = 10765, while median(newtotal) = 10762. 3 step difference.
###What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
###This seems to highly depend on how you impute the missing data. Since I used the average for #a given interval, there was practically no difference because we basically pulled the averages #closer to the inserted average value.
###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
### create new data frame
newnewactivity <- newactivity

### set up logical/test vector

weekend <- weekdays(as.Date(newnewactivity$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")

### Fill in weekday column

newnewactivity$daytype <- "weekday"

### replace "weekday" with "weekend" where day == Sat/Sun
newnewactivity$daytype[weekend == TRUE] <- "weekend"

### convert new character column to factor
newnewactivity$daytype <- as.factor(newnewactivity$daytype)

### Check out new data frame
str(newnewactivity)
